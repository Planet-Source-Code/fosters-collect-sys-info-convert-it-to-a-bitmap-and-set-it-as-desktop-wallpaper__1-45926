### Description

This app will collect your system information, save it to a bitmap and then set your desktop wallpaper to the system info bitmap. This is an excellent tool for support centres to aid with information gathering when a client PC and/or application is not behaving.

There's a lot of code here:

Collect CPU info

Get IP Address (no winsock)

Capture the screen

Save a bitmap

Set the desktop wallpaper bitmap

Set the desktop wallpaper tiling off

Refresh the desktop

All this code is extractable for your own uses.

This app requires GetCPU.dll. I have included it in the zip (renamed to GetCPU.txt - I wonder if PSC will allow it - simply rename it from txt to dll and place it in c:\windows or winnt\system32\).

Please vote and comment.
